Challenges:
	PE.com couples UI with business logic
		difficult to update the appearance, susceptible to side-effect bugs
		
	CICP repo is very large
		slows development
		difficult for CI/CD
		demands regression testing
	DB has lots of business logic
	
	file processing - one class per filetype / year
		eats up developer/QA time
		scaling issues
		difficult to provide more advanced features like scaling, fault tolerance, flexible
	
Solutions:
	More use of APIs to extract business logic from PE.com
	file processing - scalable, based on configuration and generic code, vs custom code
